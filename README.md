###### Due Wednesday, February 10, 2016

## Objectives
###### Learning Objectives
Understand how to use documentation and send messages to objects in ruby

###### Performance Objectives
* RubyDocs
* the ruby binary
* irb

## Details
###### Deliverables
Link to a GitHub Repo containing the `basics.rb` file

###### Requirements
The file should run without any errors or warnings and should only print `true`

###### Normal Mode
Only change the left hand side of each expression to make it true.

###### Difficult Mode
The way these questions are written reveals a lot of duplication. Add a `question` method that takes two arguments, the prompt for the question, and the body of the question. Use that method to [‘DRY up’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) the quiz. Requirements from Normal Mode must continue to be met.

###### Epic Mode
Data structures are awesome. Lets turn our list of questions into a single data structure and print out the answers by looping (or iterating) through them. Make sure each question is labeled with a number automatically. Requirements from Normal Mode must continue to be met.

###### Additional Resource
`basics.rb` can be found and downloaded from [here](https://gist.github.com/jah2488/1be33c0b78269f97d908)

###### Tips
* This assignment requires some googling and looking at the ruby docs.
* Try things out in IRB to see how they work. Its much faster than going directly to the file.
